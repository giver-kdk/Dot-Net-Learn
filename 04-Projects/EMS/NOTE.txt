************************************ IDENTITY SETUP ************************************

Install following packages on main EMS.Domain project:
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore 

Setup user and role: 
	- Create custom user like Employee by inheriting IdentityUser class (Models/Employee.cs)
	- Create Role Model (Models/Role.cs)
	- Update DB Context class to include User and Role (Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs)
	- Update Program.cs file to include Identity service and also enable 'Authentication'

Setup database: 
	- Create database in SSMS 
	- Set the conneciton string in appsettings.json file of main EMS project:

        "myConStr": "server=Yushuv-PC\\SQLEXPRESS; database=EMS_DB; Trusted_Connection=True; TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    },
	- Specify connection string in Program.cs file of main EMS project

Setup ASP.NET Identity as: 
	- Add migration and generate database tables with scaffold command: 
		- Make sure to have the 'dotnet-ef' command line tool installed:
			- dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
		- Scaffold the database with the following command:
			- dotnet ef migrations add InitialIdentitySetup
			- dotnet ef database update
	- After this, your Identity User Tables as well as other Model tables will be created in the database.

Initialize the Roles:

			- LoginController.cs
			- LogoutController.cs

Disable auto generation of Assembly file in all project's .csproj file:
	- <PropertyGroup>
			<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>
	  </PropertyGroup>

- Latest Update:
	- Issues with Repositories Implementation in EMS.Insfrastructure
	- Organize the package installation on only required projects



************************************ SMTP SETUP ************************************

- Create email service interface in Application Layer (Interfaces/IEmailService.cs)

- Define the 'Use Case' in the Application Layer for abstraction (UseCases/SendEmailUseCase.cs)

- Implement the email service in Infrastructure Layer by 
fetching SMTP settings from appsettings.json (Services/EmailService.cs)

- Set .env file for sensitive credentials like mail and password: 
	- Get an 'App Password' from Gmail account by enabling '2-Step Verification'
	- Install 'DotNetEnv' package in the main project
	- Add the following code in Program.cs file:
		- Env.Load();
	- Add gmail and password(generated app password) in '.env' file and ignore it in .gitignore file

- Add the environment variable in Program.cs file as: 
	- builder.Configuration.AddEnvironmentVariables();

- Update the appsettings.json file to include the SMTP settings as:
	-	{
		  "SmtpSettings": {
			"Server": "smtp.gmail.com",
			"Port": 587,
			"EnableSSL": true
		  }
		}

- Update the Program.cs file to include the SMTP settings as:
	- builder.Services.AddScoped<IEmailService, EmailService>();
	- builder.Services.AddScoped<SendEmailUseCase>(); 

- Use the email service in the main project's controller to send email to the user
