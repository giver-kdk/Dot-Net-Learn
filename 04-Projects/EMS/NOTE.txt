************************************ IDENTITY SETUP ************************************

Install following packages on main EMS.Domain project:
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore 

Setup user and role: 
	- Create custom user like Employee by inheriting IdentityUser class (Models/Employee.cs)
	- Create Role Model (Models/Role.cs)
	- Update DB Context class to include User and Role (Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs)
	- Update Program.cs file to include Identity service and also enable 'Authentication'

Setup database: 
	- Create database in SSMS 
	- Set the conneciton string in appsettings.json file of main EMS project:
	- "ConnectionStrings": {
        "myConStr": "server=Yushuv-PC\\SQLEXPRESS; database=EMS_DB; Trusted_Connection=True; TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    },
	- Specify connection string in Program.cs file of main EMS project

Setup ASP.NET Identity as: 
	- Add migration and generate database tables with scaffold command: 
		- Make sure to have the 'dotnet-ef' command line tool installed:
			- dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
		- Scaffold the database with the following command:
			- dotnet ef migrations add InitialIdentitySetup
			- dotnet ef database update
	- After this, your Identity User Tables as well as other Model tables will be created in the database.

Initialize the Roles: 
	- Create a class that creates a role(Data/RoleSeedData.cs)
	- Initialize that class in Program.cs

Create Views for Identity:
	- Create the view for user registration, login, manager and employee with folder structure as:
		- Views
			- Register
				- Index.cshtml
			- Login
				- Index.cshtml
			- Manager

			- Employee
				- Index.cshtml

Create Controllers for Identity:
	- Create the controller for user registration, login and logout with folder structure as:
		- Controllers
			- RegisterController.cs
			- LoginController.cs
			- LogoutController.cs

Disable auto generation of Assembly file in all project's .csproj file:
	- <PropertyGroup>
			<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>
	  </PropertyGroup>

- Latest Update:
	- Issues with Repositories Implementation in EMS.Insfrastructure
	- Organize the package installation on only required projects



************************************ SMTP SETUP ************************************

- Create email service interface in Application Layer (Interfaces/IEmailService.cs)

- Define the 'Use Case' in the Application Layer for abstraction (UseCases/SendEmailUseCase.cs)

- Implement the email service in Infrastructure Layer by 
fetching SMTP settings from appsettings.json (Services/EmailService.cs)

- Set .env file for sensitive credentials like mail and password: 
	- Get an 'App Password' from Gmail account by enabling '2-Step Verification'
	- Install 'DotNetEnv' package in the main project
	- Add the following code in Program.cs file:
		- Env.Load();
	- Add gmail and password(generated app password) in '.env' file and ignore it in .gitignore file

- Add the environment variable in Program.cs file as: 
	- builder.Configuration.AddEnvironmentVariables();

- Update the appsettings.json file to include the SMTP settings as:
	-	{
		  "SmtpSettings": {
			"Server": "smtp.gmail.com",
			"Port": 587,
			"EnableSSL": true
		  }
		}

- Update the Program.cs file to include the SMTP settings as:
	- builder.Services.AddScoped<IEmailService, EmailService>();
	- builder.Services.AddScoped<SendEmailUseCase>(); 

- Use the email service in the main project's controller to send email to the user
	- Send mail when manager approves/rejects the leave request of the employee



*********************************** Hanfire for Auto Task Scheduler ***********************************

- Install Hangfire package in the main project

- Add hangfire service in Program.cs file:
	- builder.Services.AddHangfire(config => config.UseSqlServerStorage(connectionString));
	- builder.Services.AddHangfireServer();       

- Use the Hangire service in the main project's controller to schedule the task



************************************ SignalR SETUP ************************************
- Concept: 
	-  SignalR is a real-time bidirectional communication system when user is connected.
	- So, it should be sued in apps where user is connected and requries real-time updates.
	- It is not used in apps where user is not connected (Eg: Background Notification)
	- It is not good for Video Streaming because it is one-directional communication.
	- SignalR is used in chat application, notification system, stock market, google docs live update, etc.

- SIgnalR Hub: Central component to connect client and server to transfer data
- Clients: Web, Mobile, Desktop, etc connected to the server with SignalR
- Groups: Clients are grouped together into subgroups to send message to those specific groups

- Create Notification Model for storing notification in database
- Create Notification Interface and Service as its implementation
	- Notification service was created for SignalR integration
- Integrate notification with manager's leave request approval/rejection action
- Create LeaveNotificationHub for message pass and added it with signalR in Program.cs
- Add signalr javascript CDN on layout.cshtml clientside
- Creat Notification View to list all the notification rom the database for particular employee

Todo: Goto NotificationService.cs and LeaveRequestHub.cs for complete implementation



************************************ CLOUDINARY IMAGE SETUP ************************************
- Install following packages: 
	- CloudinaryDotNet in main project and Infrastructure Layer
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http in Application Layer

- Add the cloudinary service in Program.cs file
	- Get the cloudinary credentials from the cloudinary website
	- Store the cloudinary credentials in the .env file

- Create the image uploader interface (IImageService.cs)

- Implement the image uploader service in Infrastructure Layer (Services/CLoudinaryService.cs)




********************************* NOTIFY JS SETUP *********************************
- Download the notify.js file from https://notifyjs.jpillora.com/
- Add the notify.js file in the wwwroot/js folder of the main project
- Add the notify.js file in the layout.cshtml file of the main project
- Use notify.js jqueries to show notification on View pages
