- When request is sent from browser to server, the request doesn't go directly to controller
- It goes as: 
	Request --> Request Pipeline --> Controller
- So, basically, middleware is a function that processes request before reaching the controller
- Let us assume 3 middlewares M1, M2 and M3 then the request passes as:
	- Request --> (M1 --> M2 --> M3 --> M2 --> M1) --> Controller
- The request pipeline is the sequence of middlewares
- ASP.NET can have 'n' number of middlewares
- The order of middleware matters as the request passes through them in the order they are defined
- Example: 
	- Routing
	- Authentication
	- Exception Handling, etc.



- Write the middleware code inside Program.cs on: 
// ******************* Configure Request Pipeline (Middlewares) *******************
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");				// Pre-defined Middleware
    app.UseHsts();
}
// ********************************************************************************
